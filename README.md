# Time Series Analysis on Superstore

SQL Project Idea: 

Clean the data using data preprocessing methods.

Use of the LEAD window function to create a new column sales_next that displays the sales of the next row in the dataset.

Create a new column sales_previous to display the values of the row above a given row.

Rank the data based on sales in descending order (RANK function).

Use of common SQL commands and aggregate functions to show the monthly and daily sales averages.

Analyze discounts on two consecutive days.

Evaluate moving averages using the window functions.
